# GoLangBruteExample

Example Online brute-force code written in Go Lang.

Concept: Query with data and validation of the result. All you have to do is add the ability to use a proxy, change the response processing logic.

The author is not responsible for the consequences. The project was made for the good, so that there was an opportunity to conduct load testing :)
